# I used React to build the project including hooks like usestate, use effect, then I used bootstrap, fontawesome to work and help me in the UI and responsive design, then I used Axios to get data from the API, then I used Formik and Yup to manage forms, verify and process data, and facilitate dealing with the form in general, then after that I displayed the products and verified the data using Yup on the registration and login page.

# Using axios to fetch data from API

# Using CSS codes inside JSX codes and creating element formats

# Use the bootstrap framework to create a responsive design and add style to the page

# Use formik on both the registration and login page.
Facilitate the management of forms in terms of case management, data validation, and Submit Handling

# Use yup on both the registration and login page.
To validate form data and give clear error messages if input is incorrect.

# At first I had a problem uploading the images but I overcame this problem

# To run the project, you must first download the project from GitHub. The second step is to open the project on vs code, then run npm start to display the project in the browser, then download the libraries in the project such as bootstrap, fontawesome, axios, formik, yup. After that, you can work with the project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
